# TODO - Data Analysis Improvements for DataFlow Assistant

Based on the features described in `README.md`, here are some potential improvements to enhance the data analysis capabilities of DataFlow Assistant:

## Data Validation Enhancements

- **Add Data Type Validation:**
    - Ensure columns adhere to expected data types (numeric, string, date, etc.).
    - Provide options to automatically coerce data types or flag inconsistencies.
- **Implement Range Validation:**
    - Allow users to define valid ranges for numerical columns.
    - Flag values outside the defined ranges as invalid.
- **Support Custom Validation Rules:**
    - Enable users to define and apply custom validation rules using expressions or scripts.
    - Provide a user-friendly interface to create and manage custom rules.

## Imputation Method Expansion
    - Allow users to define valid ranges for numerical columns.
    - Flag values outside the defined ranges as invalid.
- **Support Custom Validation Rules:**
    - Enable users to define and apply custom validation rules using expressions or scripts.
    - Provide a user-friendly interface to create and manage custom rules.

## Imputation Method Expansion

- **Offer Advanced Imputation Techniques:**
    - Implement median and mode imputation as alternatives to mean imputation.
    - Integrate KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) imputation for more sophisticated handling of missing values.
    - Explore and potentially include MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) for advanced statistical imputation.

## Feature Engineering Capabilities

- **Introduce Feature Engineering Tools:**
    - Implement functionality for creating interaction features (combinations of existing features).
    - Add support for polynomial feature generation.
    - Include binning for numerical features to create categorical features.
    - Implement one-hot encoding and other encoding methods for categorical variables.

## Data Transformation Techniques

- **Integrate Data Transformation Methods:**
    - Offer scaling and normalization techniques (Min-Max scaling, StandardScaler).
    - Implement logarithmic and power transformations to handle skewed data.
    - Provide options for other relevant transformations based on data distribution.

## Statistical Analysis Expansion

- **Enhance Statistical Analysis Features:**
    - Include descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.) for numerical columns.
    - Implement hypothesis testing capabilities for comparing groups or testing assumptions.
    - Add distribution analysis tools (histograms, density plots, QQ plots) to understand data distributions.

## Data Visualization Improvements

- **Expand Data Visualization Options:**
    - Add the ability to generate histograms for visualizing data distributions.
    - Implement scatter plots for exploring relationships between two numerical variables.
    - Include box plots for comparing distributions across categories.
    - Support time series plots for time-dependent data.
    - Allow users to customize plot aesthetics and export visualizations.

## Integration and Reporting

- **Improve Integration with Data Science Libraries:**
    - Enhance compatibility with scikit-learn for model development workflows.
    - Consider integration with statsmodels for statistical modeling.
    - Explore integration with other relevant Python data science libraries.
- **Generate Automated Data Analysis Reports:**
    - Create functionality to automatically generate reports summarizing data validation results.
    - Include key descriptive statistics and visualization summaries in reports.
    - Allow users to customize report content and format.

## Data Source and Handling Improvements

- **Expand Data Source Support:**
    - Extend data ingestion capabilities to support databases (SQL, NoSQL).
    - Integrate with cloud storage services (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage).
    - Explore the possibility of connecting to data APIs.
- **Implement Data Sampling Techniques:**
    - Add data sampling methods (random sampling, stratified sampling) for efficient handling of large datasets.
    - Allow users to specify sample sizes or proportions.

These improvements aim to make DataFlow Assistant a more comprehensive tool for data analysis, providing users with a wider range of functionalities to prepare and understand their data effectively.
